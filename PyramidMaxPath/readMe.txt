It calculates and finds max amount of all possible pyramid's paths on such conditions:

1. Each next number should be different in "even-odd" sense, it means, that sequence should looks like even -> odd -> even -> odd, etc. For example, 5 -> 8 -> 3 -> 12 -> 9.

2. The paths in pyramid are allowed down or diagonal.
